# data-generation-using-modelling-and-simulation-for-machine-learning
A simulation-driven machine learning study that generates synthetic queueing data to compare five regression models for predicting service waiting times. Using randomized queue parameters, the study shows Random Forest outperforming other models by best capturing the system’s non-linear dynamics.
